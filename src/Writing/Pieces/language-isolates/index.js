        <p>I’ve been very into the online game Geoguessr for the last 2 and a half months. For those who don’t know, Geoguessr is a web-based geography challenge game, in which the player is placed into a random google street view location and has to guess where they are in the world on a map. I’ve always been good at geography (I was in the geo bee in 6th and 7th grade) and I like traveling, so naturally I became a fiend for Geoguessr. Once I found out that one of my new college friends also was a Geoguessr aficionado, we’ve played pretty much every day.</p>

<p>From an outsider’s perspective, Geoguessr seems insanely difficult. How are you supposed to accurately guess your precise location in the world just from your surroundings, especially with a time limit? A good starting point is to look for signs, billboards, trucks, or any other object that has writing on it. Figuring out the language(s) spoken in your location is crucial for any Geoguessr round.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot about various languages during my Geoguessr career, mostly out of necessity, as well as curiosity. For example, learning the differences between the Nordic languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic and Finnish) is crucial.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of language I’ve learned about is the existence of language isolates. Language isolates are languages that cannot be grouped into any other language family due to their differences from any other languages.</p>

<p>Usually, languages can be grouped into clumps of similar languages, which often are derived from similar roots. For example, the romance languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian) all have strong Latin roots. If you’ve heard two or more of these languages spoken, you know what I mean, they all sound somewhat similar, you can tell they’re related.</p>

<p>The opposite is true for language isolates. One example is Basque, which is spoken by the Basque people in  -you guessed it-  the Basque country in northern Spain. Even though the Basque lands are surrounded by Spanish and French speakers (both romance languages), Basque sounds nothing like either tongue. Historians believe that Basque is one of the oldest languages in Europe and that it may offer information on the early settlers of the Iberian peninsula and the continent as a whole.</p>

<p>The current theory is that Basque is related to the languages spoken by hunter-gatherers who migrated to the area around 7000 years ago. After those people settled down throughout Europe and intermingled with the resident hunter-gatherers, it is thought that the Basque country got separated from the rest of the continent, geographically, culturally, and linguistically. Thus, the Basque people are now a distinct, proud ethnic group within Spain.</p>

<p>Another popularly spoken language isolate is Korean. At first glance, Korean characters may not seem that much different from those of the Chinese and Japanese, their closest neighbors. The spoken language is a different story, however. Chinese and Japanese are tonal languages, which means that the tone with which you speak words affects the meaning. Korean does not use these tones, among other differences.</p>

<p>Yet, Korean may soon lose its status as a language isolate. Due to the historically recent Korean war and subsequent split of the peninsula, North and South Korea have developed different dialects of the Korean language. If the two nations continue their tense relationship, in which there is little contact between them, their dialects are likely to grow even further apart. If they ever become distinct enough to be two different languages, then Korean will become its own language tree, and cease to be a language isolate.</p>

<p>I personally find it so cool that modern historical events can create new dialects of language, which we can observe in real time. We tend to view language as a static concept, but language is constantly evolving and changing. As a young person, I am actively participating in the evolution of the English language via slang and internet language, but I digress.</p>

<p>My personal favorite language isolate, Hungarian, isn’t even officially considered a language isolate, but is isolated geographically in the middle of Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is one of the hardest Geoguessr regions to guess in due to my inability to recognize or read most of the Slavic languages.</p>

<p>Hungarians as an ethnic group are also known as Magyars. The Magyars are a group of Turkic origin surrounded by Slavs, and have a distinct cultural and ethnic identity. One of the most important aspects of their ethnic identity is the Hungarian language (also called Magyar), which doesn’t resemble any other language. Linguists theorize that Hungarian traces back to Siberia, but other sources say that it might be a descendant of the language of the Scythians, Huns, Turks, Avars, and/or Sumerians.</p>

<p>Magyar is a notoriously difficult language to learn due to its stark differences in vocabulary and grammar when compared to any other European language. The language has complex grammar that is often difficult to learn for English speakers.</p>

<p>Similarly to Basque, the main reason that Hungarian has become isolated is Hungary’s geographic isolation. The Hungarian plain is surrounded on all 4 sides by mountains, which allowed Hungary to develop its distinct language with little outside influence.</p>

<p>Hungary uses a lot of suffixes and prefixes, which leads to a lot of long words. Here is one extreme example, “Megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért”, which translates to “for your continued behavior as if you could not be desecrated” in English. Hungarian also uses a lot of accents over its vowels, which makes it easy to recognize.</p>

<p>I find language isolates cool because they offer windows into linguistic history. The label of language isolate is just a label. No language is truly isolated because all languages came from somewhere, and evolved in their own unique ways. As more research is done and more work is done in the field of linguistics, some language isolates will be isolated no more.</p>
