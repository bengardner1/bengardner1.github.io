                    <p> Hello, my name is Ben, welcome to my website! I am currently studying Computer Science at Northeastern University's Khoury College with a concentration in Software. I was introduced to coding by the AP Computer Science A class during my senior year of high school. Ever since, it has been what I wanted to do!</p>
                    <p>My goal for my career is to utilize my skills to create technology that makes peoples' lives easier so they can focus on what really matters. I am interested in working in a variety of industries, but am especially interested in music tech. I would like to have my own company one day, so I want to absorb as much industry knowledge as I can in the early stages of my career. I have experience with Java, C#, Python, SQL, Javascript, and others listed on my resume. I am always excited to have to opportunity to learn new technologies/languages.</p>
                    <p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/west+hartford/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e7acf5890414fd:0x67f9d7530e513b7c?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQ_fS46aODAxWKv4kEHchVDtAQh8EJegQIERAA" target="_blank">West Hartford, CT</a> and moved to Boston (where I am currently based) to attend Northeastern University. I am half Taiwanese ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼! When I'm not coding, I like to read about history, play Magic the Gathering, and play with my dog, Star. I also like to play saxophone when I have the time. If you either like or hate this website, please let me know! How does it make you feel? </p>
